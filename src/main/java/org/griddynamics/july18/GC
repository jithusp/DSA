Ergonomics is the process by which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and garbage collection heuristics, such as behavior-based heuristics, improve application performance.

The JVM provides platform-dependent default selections for the garbage collector, heap size, and runtime compiler. These selections match the needs of different types of applications while requiring less command-line tuning. In addition, behavior-based tuning dynamically optimizes the sizes of the heap to meet a specified behavior of the application.
